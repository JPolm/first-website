            <h2 class="column-header">Why I love Camping</h2>
            <p class="column-text">One of the main reasons I enjoy camping so much is because of its ability to release the pressure of life. It allows you to forget about the stress of school or work and just relax. For me being in nature helps me find joy in the peacefull wind that blows through the tree line, or the songs that the birds and rivers play. I have been camping since I was a kid going up to Blackrock. Ever since then I have fallen in love with it. Over the summer i hope to take multiple trips and hiking expiditions with friends all over Califorina.</p>

            <p>Camping itsleft is a great activity to do ovenight or for a weekend getaway. However, once you get more comforterable camping and being in the wilderness there are countless new activities to explore. Some of my favorite activities inlclude hiking, fishing, or just relaxing with friends around the camp fire. Each of these can be tailored to suit your personal prefernces and can last as long as you want. Whether or not you want to take a quick 2 mile hike for liesure, or hike the whole of yosimite valley, camping is a great way to get out and do it.</p>

            <h2 class="column-header">Places and Seasons To Camp</h2>
            <p>Living in California is great becuase of all the wonderfull and vast places to camp. Some of these include places like Yosimite or Kings Canyon National Park, Sierra National Forrest, or any of the other parks and forrests in the state. A couple great places are also along the Califorina coast; camping on the beach offers a new refreshing feel to camping. Some of the best times of year to camp are typically during the summer, but usually range from April though October depending on location and weather conditions. </p>
